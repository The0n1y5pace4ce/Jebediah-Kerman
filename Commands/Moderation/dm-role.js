//  WARNING
//  â€¢ | This command will wait 3 seconds before DMing the next member with the role. This is to prevent harassing the API, which can lead to bans.
//  â€¢ | 3 seconds is safe and shouldn't lead to any bans.
//  â€¢ | Be aware that for roles being on a lot of members this might take a while, you can lower the waiting time between each DM at your own risk of getting API banned.
//  â€¢ | However if you want to decrease the timings, it's your choice. For example to change the 5 second delay to 3 you would change delay(5000) to delay(3000)
//  â€¢ | I am not responsible for any API bans as I purposely increased the delays to prevent this.
